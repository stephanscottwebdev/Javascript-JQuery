<!--
I used a JSON file from an example from a Javascript30 course I plan on taking while I look for a job to better my JS portfolio. Im following a tutorial and hopefully commenting enough to explain whats going on to show you I understand the functions and calls used in this example for my final.

const cities = []; // Empty array for cities to go into a Const, a const creates a constant that can be either global or local to the function in which it is declared. Using a constant is efficient because its replaced after its compiled and allow for dead code removal so the use will allow JS to know that opimizations are possible. So its more like a flag to a JS engine to let the compiler know that new optimizations can be used.
fetch(endpoint) // Fetch is a new API in the browser. Html request, similar to JQuery $.get. This is a built in browser one. The browser does not know what data its showing. Thats where the blob.json is used. It tells the fetch what data type is is. Throwing the .push into it the cities variable.

/* The then() function is related to "Javascript promises" that are used in some libraries or frameworks like jQuery or AngularJS.
A promise is a pattern for handling asynchronous operations. The promise allows you to call a method called "then" that lets you specify the function(s) to use as the callbacks.*/
