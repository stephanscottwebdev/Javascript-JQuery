document.write(oneWeek);</script></p>
<p>Create and dispaly a new Date object called tenDays with the date 10 days from today. <strong>10 Days from today is: </strong> <script> var tenDays = new Date(); tenDays.setDate(tenDays.getDate() + 10);

var mm = today1.getMonth()+1; //January is 0!
var yyyy = today1.getFullYear(); 
if(dd<10){dd='0'+dd} if(mm<10){mm='0'+mm}

var today1 = mm+'/'+dd+'/'+yyyy; 
 document.write(today1);</script>	(Hint: get the individual pieces from the date object and concatenate them together with the slashes)</p>

<p>Format today's date into dd/mm/yyyy and display: 
 <script>
var today2 = new Date();
